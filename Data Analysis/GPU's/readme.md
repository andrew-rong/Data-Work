# Graphics Cards

## Why this project?

As someone with a hobby in technology, I like to keep up with the latest hardware, being able to see the rapid advancement in technology at a consumer level fascinating. So this project is dedicated to that interest!


## Explanation 
CPU : Central Processing Unit

GPU : Graphics Processing Unit

The GPU is the graphics card, that renders the images, videos, essentially what you see on a screen. Without getting into the specifics of how it works, its sole purpose is to take the display task from the CPU to lighten its load and allow the CPU to focus on literally everything else, as in the programs you are running.

Now in the modern day, the graphics card is commonly found used for gaming, video and rendering. In these situations the capability of each card has an impact on efficiency and performance. Say you want to edit a video, with a weak graphics card it will be difficult to render your finished product by a substantial amount.

## Tasks and Goals
For this project we will be scraping data from the website:  https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/

This website acts as a database for the numerical information on Graphics Cards. The main tasks about this project is to:

### Scrape the data
### Clean and Process
### Explore and Analyze
### Model 
### Interpret

All my notes and comments are available directly in the code, enjoy!
