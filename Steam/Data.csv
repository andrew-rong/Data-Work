5,159017230,english,"I always measure a video game by how it makes me feel after the sessions I spend playing through the game. Very rarely do I run into games where after I play, I not only crave for more of the experience, but I feel completely satisfied that my time was worth spending experiencing a game's world, lore, and characters. God of War (2018) is not just a video game, it is a cinematic experience that can seamlessly transition between video game and cinema.

The cinema aspect comes from the game's story about a father (Kratos) and his son (Atreus) and their journey to spread their mother's ashes on top of the highest peak in all the realms. It’s a story about parenting, and how Kratos and Atreus learn to become better people in wake of the mother’s passing. Kratos learns to become a better father for Atreus, and also for himself to be a bigger person than the murderous enraged wrecking ball he used to be in the previous games. Atreus learns to become a man through Kratos’s teachings and experience, slowly getting stronger and stronger as his learns from mistake after mistake. Kratos and Atreus’s personal journey is brilliantly contrasted by the game’s main antagonist, Baldur. For a great explanation on why Baldur is such a great villain in this game, I would recommend checking out this YouTube video by FatBrett. He makes great analysis videos on the characters within this game and its sequel, Ragnarok: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9vSCABh1K8

Speaking of Kratos, this game is technically the 4th entry in the God of War series. Despite this, I went into this game without any knowledge of God of War, and I followed along with the story and characters easily. Halfway through the game, I realized that anyone could pick up this game and easily understand what was going on without any prior knowledge of Kratos or other characters. If that turned you off from picking up this game, I can assure you you’re only robbing yourself from an unforgettable experience by delaying your purchase of this game (No, this review isn’t sponsored).

The gameplay is akin to hack-and-slash RPGs such as the first two Kingdom Hearts games and Dark Souls, and gives the traditional hack-and-slash game genre a more cinematic flare with its dynamic camera angles and fluid controls. The game also has a great amount of optional exploration involved, where if you’re willing to sink even more hours into this game, you will be greatly rewarded with upgrades and weapons that’ll help you with late game enemies and bosses.

In my opinion, I would not classify this as a game. Rather, I’d classify God of War as an ‘experience’. It easily makes my Top 5 video games of all time, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in a single-player experience they’re willing to drown hours upon hours of time.",1708650235,1708650235,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,True,,76561198847475285,96,26,2072,894,1066,1709514990

Teaching and growing as a god, while having responsibility of Atreus. The cut scenes are stunning, combat is around the same level as the Witcher.
