       "  'review': 'It\\'s rare to see this much polish (on a console to PC port) right out of the gate. Sony has really put a lot of time and effort into making sure that this game was ready for release. It is even equipped with DLSS and FSR right \"out of the box\", which really shows that Sony are treating PC gamers to a level of optimisation rarely seen from other developers (cough Rockstar). Jumping into Ultra settings gets you the visual upgrade you would expect to see on PC over console. While the story and controls are as solid and intuitive (respectively) as they were on console. This is really the best version of the game available, and I look forward to seeing more Playstation titles being ported to PC by Sony. If this is the bar, they set it high!',\n",

I have a high end PC, and was worried it would still be rough, but i am easily running this at 1440p Ultra 90fps+. \\n\\nAs for the game, the story is incredible, world is gorgeous, characters are very well done along with their voice acting. The combat is intense, and brutal. The music is incredible as well. This game is a masterpiece, that should be played by everyone. Use DLSS if you need better fps, cause they did a good job supporting that.',\n",

       "  'review': \"It is hard to explain the emotions you go through when you experience this game. I'm in early 40s and i have played a lot of games during my life. Only few games I considered memorable, generational games that defined what an amazing game is and God of War goes beyond this.\\n\\nGod of War, for the lack of a better word, is a masterpiece. It is subjectively the best game made I have ever played in my life. An emotional epic that not only delivers Oscar worthy story and performances from actors but game mechanics and presentation that are brutal, satisfying and fluid. Not only it looks unbelievable and cinematic in it's the scope and engaging gameplay, it pays homage to everything that came before it in the series.\\n\\nI have played ALL previous God of War games including mobile releases and the emotions you feel playing this game having experienced the whole backstory in previous games and Kratos' history is incomparable to anything else. But even if you haven't, you will not feel left out. \\n\\nAgain, a masterpiece of modern storytelling and game development. Do not miss this game, it redefines what a truly epic game is.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"It's rather sad to see so many Triple-A game companies over the last decade focus on repetitive gameplay and constant microtransactions - their focus being to keep you paying and playing their game over and over again. \\nGaming was supposed to be 'a movie where you have the control' but that concept has been lost in time, due to greed. \\n\\nNot God of war...\\n\\nGod of War is 5 year old console game, that was released on Playstation, and then re-ported to PC - and their PC port stands up better than most other AAA titles that have been released. It didn't crash once, neither did I have any fps drops throughout my journey. I was surprised by how stable the port was.\\n\\nThe game comes with a mechanically sound and fairly satisfying combat system. If you know the trilogy you will be happy to know the fighting is very much the same - to a degree. Hack and slash, but remember - there is a boy travelling with Kratos now, so the extreme and brutal god that Kratos used to be, is repressed by the fact he now has to fight along side his son. But that allows for an exciting new set of fighting mechanics. Kratos being the front line power house and Arteus the back line archer. \\nThis mixture makes for a very interesting battle mechanic.  \\n\\nKratos, the fearsome ex Greek god who once wore the mantle of God of War, has escaped his violent past to Midgard. The earth of Norse legends. There, he starts a family and lives a quiet life in the woods. But Midgard has its own pantheon of gods, with their own agendas. The presence of a foreign god in their land can't stay unnoticed for long and the past Kratos is trying to forget is but one unfortunate encounter away.\\n\\nAn interesting world based on Norse myth, full of lore to discover and things to learn. Perhaps most importantly, some absolutely beautiful vistas and many wonderfully fantastical locales to discover. The game does allow you to visit several realms, so there is a fair amount of variety. The world is further enhanced by the obviously high production values. The graphics and music is absolutely breathtaking and fitting - I was left standing around on occasions just admiring the view. \\n\\nAll in all, this was a wonderful worthwhile experience. We certainly need more high-budget, quality single-player games on the platform. Particularly those lacking loot boxes and other such monetisation nonsense. I certainly recommend it to all fans of single-player action-adventures, as well as Greek and Norse myth.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"It is hard to explain the emotions you go through when you experience this game. I am 41 years old and i have played a lot of games during my life. Only few games I considered memorable, generational games that defined what an amazing game is and God of War goes beyond this.\\n\\nI have played ALL previous God of War games including mobile releases and the emotions you feel playing this game having experienced the whole backstory in previous games and Kratos' history is incomparable to anything else. But even if you haven't, you will not feel left out.\\n\\nIt's a masterpiece.this is the greatest game I’ve ever played. There is not a single thing I disliked. It’s been years since I played a game that kept me that invested into a story, into its characters and world. It’s beautiful. And with tears streaming down my face An emotional epic that not only delivers Oscar worthy story and performances from actors but game mechanics and presentation that are brutal, satisfying and fluid. Not only it looks unbelievable and cinematic in it's the scope and engaging gameplay, it pays homage to everything that came before it in the series. I’m ready to pick up the leviathan and head out with Atreus to explore this gorgeous world to its fullest. I still have many bosses to do battle with and some more mythology to uncover.I’m so happy to have had experienced it.\\n\\nAgain, a masterpiece of modern storytelling and game development. Do not miss this game, it redefines what a truly epic game is.\\n\\nAbsolute masterpiece.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'About two-thirds of the way through the game I had this thought pop into my head. \"I\\'m not playing a game; I\\'m having an experience.\" That’s what it is like when playing this game, an experience. The graphics, the setting, the lore, the gameplay, the set-pieces, the voice acting, the emotions, the story. All fantastic.\\n\\nAs a father, I’ve experienced losing a child and the grief that comes with such a loss. At the beginning of the game, I felt every bit of Kratos’ loss. I felt and understood the difficulty to bond with your child during a time of grief; the overwhelming fear that comes over you when you see your kids go down the wrong path; the pride when witnessing their growth. I also felt every bit of Frea’s pain; the compulsive need to protect your child at all costs and the consequences of doing so. Thankfully, these feelings and emotions aren\\'t ignored infavor of action. The story gives the characters plenty of time to fully experience, explore, and process these feelings until their ultimate conclussion.\\n\\nWhile Kratos and Andreas process their grief, they navigate through beautifully realized worlds and battle interesting and unique monsters. The battles flowed well, and the combat controls were spot on. The fight with the dragon and the various fights with the Stranger are epic in execution and scale. By the end of the game, I felt like an absolute bad ass.\\n\\nLastly, I have never played any of the previous God of War games and I did not feel lost or that I needed to have played previous installments to understand what was happening in the story. The things I needed to know were shown to me and that is a huge plus.\\n\\nThis game is an absolute gem and I can\\'t wait to play Ragnarok whenever it makes it to PC.',\n",

I just got bored of them so quick and it felt like the repetitive same old same old that lots of AAA games have nowadays.\\n\\nI heard so many good stories about God of War that I had high expectations when I first bought it, and I'm so happy I did.\\nThis game exceeds all expectations in every single way imaginable. \\n\\nThe character development of every individual you encounter is unique in its own way, the way the world is build is absolutely breathtaking and its amazing to just explore all the little things hidden away. Its so immersive and you really get to feel for Kratos and his son. Every time you start up this game you're in for a new adventure, not one time have I felt like something I was doing seemed familiar. Its much more than just a hack-and-slash game, the fighting mechanics are really well thought through and feel really smooth, the graphics are absolutely amazing. I can easily say that God Of War is on my Top 3 best games ever played.\\n\\n11/10 MUST BUY\",\n",

       "  'review': \"PC Specific:\\n\\nPerformance: Outstanding. This is probably the first AAA game in years that manages to release in an almost perfect state when it comes to optimization. So far no crashes, hitting full 144fps at 1440p without a single dip that i noticed, this just feels absolutely great to play. (will update if this changes while progressing through the game) \\n\\nControls: M/KB works fine so does an xbox controller, think for this one i'll stick with the latter (rare for me) simply because thats how i played the main trilogy as well.\\n\\nVisuals: Outstanding again. I've seen the entire game at release and compared to how crisp the game looks now, 3/4 years later on PC it absolutely looks like a game that would release in 2022. You can Disable annoyances (i.e motion blur) and with HDR enabled, the lighting/shadows and color palette look absolutely stunning, seriously turn it on for this one even on lower luminance screens this will look fantastic. \\n\\nThe Game itself: Just buy it, i don't think i can add anything that hasn't been said about this masterpiece before. This is simply put a must own even if its just for the incredible acting performances of pretty much everyone involved. \\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': '- DIFFICULTY -\\n\\n🔲 My 90 year old grandma could play it\\n🔲 Easy\\n☑️ Normal\\n☑️ Hard (Challenge mode)\\n☑️ \"Dark Souls\" (Give Me \"God of War\" mode)\\n\\n[i]Okay, this will be controversial. The game expects you to be alert and quick in your reflexes and make full use of the range of combat mechanics in the harder levels and the punishment curve, at least in my own personal opinion, is quite steep.[/i]\\n\\n- GRAPHICS -\\n\\n🔲 \"MS Paint\"\\n🔲 Bad\\n🔲 Meh\\n🔲 Graphics don\\'t matter in this game\\n🔲 Good\\n🔲 Beautiful\\n☑️ Masterpiece\\n\\n- MUSIC -\\n\\n🔲 Bad\\n🔲 Not special\\n🔲 Good\\n☑️ Beautiful\\n\\n[i]Bear McCreary has worked his magic in creating a score that fits the baritone of Kratos\\' voice and the atmosphere of pain, perseverance and grit quite appropriately. There are gentler sections when need be, and fast strings and chanting vocals accompanied by brass during the more epic boss fights. It\\'s great and totally immersive.[/i]\\n\\n- STORY -\\n\\n🔲 This game has no story\\n🔲 Like playing \"Temple Runners\" for the story\\n🔲 It\\'s there for the people who want it\\n🔲 Well written\\n☑️ Epic story\\n\\n[i]Santa Monica Studios have always been known for telling a really gripping story throughout the history of this franchise, and this GoW is no exception, grabbing the attention of the players right from the get-go. The game does expect you to do the basic homework regarding the background of Kratos though, and once that is taken care of, the story has no lack of gravitas and nostalgia, coupled with frequent stunning set-pieces and consistent pacing.[/i]\\n\\n[i]I nominated this for Outstanding Story-rich game for 2022 Steam Awards.[/i]\\n\\n- PRICE -\\n\\n🔲 Underpriced\\n🔲 Perfect price\\n☑️ Could be cheaper\\n🔲 Overpriced\\n🔲 Complete waste of money\\n\\n[i]Sony could have released it a bit lesser than 2018 pricing, mere $10 rebate in 4 years seems a bit steep. Yet as far as substance is concerned, the game strongly holds its value and is still a valid purchase.[/i]\\n\\n- REQUIREMENTS -\\n\\n🔲 You can run it on a microwave\\n☑️ Average\\n☑️ High end\\n🔲 \"NASA\" computer\\n\\n[i]The PC port is near flawless, and the early frame drops in wider areas and stuttering that I have encountered have all been (or being) patched actively. Due to the presence of custom frame rate capping and support for Fidelity FX and NVIDIA DLSS, it does not take the cutting edge modern system to get a decent experience. That said, Current or one generation old hardware can really portray the beauty of the colour palette and fluidity in the combat the to the fullest.\\n\\nJust for context, I am using a Ryzen 5600X, 16GB 3200Mhz memory and a 3070Ti FE GPU and it has been buttery.[/i]\\n\\n- LENGTH -\\n\\n🔲 Very short (0 - 3 hours)\\n🔲 Short (3 - 15 hours)\\n☑️ Average (15 - 50 hours)\\n☑️ Long (50 - 90 hours) (for completionist runs)\\n🔲 Extremely long (90 - 110 hours)\\n🔲 No Ending (you can literally get lost in the map and not do any quests and still have loads of fun)\\n\\n[i]The PC playthrough is my third, the two prior being the basic one and then getting my rear smacked in \"Give Me God of War\" difficulty in New Game+. This run would have its focus on completing everything (main+side quests, optional bosses) in a single playthrough and by my experience, 90 hours should suffice.[/i]\\n\\n- FUN -\\n\\n🔲 I\\'d rather watch paint dry\\n🔲 Hard to enjoy\\n🔲 Repetitive\\n🔲 Actually pretty amusing\\n☑️ Ride of your life\\n\\n[i]Overwhelmingly fun game. That\\'s it. That\\'s the description.[/i]\\n\\n- REPLAYABILITY -\\n\\n🔲 It\\'s a one - time experience\\n🔲 Only for achievements\\n🔲 If you wait a few months / years\\n☑️ Definitely\\n🔲 Infinitely replayable\\n\\n[i]The game has some sections that you would need to revisit (not having the right gear to unlock hidden regions) and there are higher difficulty levels to explore in future runs (the game recommends to save the hardest till at least the completion of a single run) and then there\\'s New Game+ where you start with all accumulated gear and skills from prior runs. That said, it\\'s a minor disappointment that although New Game+ has fresh sets of armour, it does not introduce fancier ways to take the enemies down.[/i]\\n\\n- WORTH BUYING -\\n\\n🔲 No\\n🔲 Wait for sale\\n☑️ Yes',\n",

This one ran like butter and made the already amazing experience a lot more enjoyable.\\n\\nI am a longtime Zelda fan, and this might look a bit too far fetched but the level design and the way the story develops reminded me a lot to the original formula Zelda games had, of course BOTW has its own magic but before this I couldn't imagine what a game with that intriguing game design would feel like with current gen graphics and engines. I truly loved every minute of my gameplay. Still, there's some grinding if you want to complete it at a 100% but it really pays off.\\n\\nThe story is, *chef's kiss*, excellent, sadly since I would never have expected God of War to come to PC I had already been spoiled a bit when it originally came out in 2018, but that was so long ago I barely remembered and that didn't stop me from having a big smile on my face on that ending, great story telling.\\n\\nI'm looking forward to playing Ragnarok some day on PC, fingers crossed, even if it takes more than the 4 years this one took.\",\n",

I will say as someone come from zero prior experience, the game does a fine job of introducing relevant backstory elements in a way that isn't confusing, but may leave you wondering whats going on.\\n\\nDid I mention steam deck? Yes I did! This game works fairly well after scaling back a few settings. I think the steam deck has trouble with atmospheric stuff like clouds. When you bring those down and increase the quality of everything else, it runs really well. My only issue with it is that when it does crash you have to hard reboot the deck to get out of the crash.\\n\\nWould recommend to anyone that wants a glimpse into the God of War storyline that hasn't experienced it before.\",\n",
