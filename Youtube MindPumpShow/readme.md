# Why this project
After completing a few smaller scale projects, I wanted to create another one where everything I've learned 
about plotting, gathering and applying models is demonstrated. 

You can look into my past folders and see my growth, the subtle changes in code, layout and methods.

# Why MindPump?
As someone who is really invested and finds enjoyment in fitness, MindPump was a crew that I discovered midway through 2021. The crew not only helped me during those tough times
but also they taught me so much about fitness and changed my view on it. If you listen to what they say, you'd think they were crazy but the knowledge, experience and even science
that they use to deliver their message will definitely change your view on fitness as well. They are very highly recommeneded by me to anyone curious or into fitness right now.
