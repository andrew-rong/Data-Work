Hi

Being interested in a variety of things like Data, Finance and Machine Learning I enjoy creating small projects that put all my interests together. 

Through my background of Mathematics and Statistics I specialized in Financial Mathematics and Actuarial Science, but found a passion for data along the way. Aiming for a Computer Science Minor, majority of my courses taught me about data manipulation, applying different machine learning models and general software skills. This repository is for the projects I have done outside of school but I also have my projects done within school as well.

You'll find in here some projects that I have done, ranging from learning how to do small tasks like draw from APIs, to full blown analysis on datasets.

Truth be told this is something that I started to do out of enjoyment, working with data, finding trends, predicitng outcomes all of it really drew me in to this field and I am looking for full time opportunities to apply the skills that I learned both independently and through post secondary.
