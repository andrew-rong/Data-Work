Hi I'm Andrew Rong

I'm interested in a variety of things such as Data Analytics, Finance and Machine Learning.

Through my background of Mathematics and Statistics I specialized in Financial Mathematics and Actuarial Science, but found a passion for data. Majority of my courses is based around programming and computer science, where I learn about data manipulation, cleaning and applying different machine learning methods on top. This repository is for the projects I have done outside of school but I also have my projects done within school as well.

You'll find in here some projects that I have done, ranging from learning how to do small tasks like draw from APIs, to full blown analysis on datasets.

Truth be told this is something that I started to do out of enjoyment, working with data, finding trends, predicitng outcomes all of it really drew me in to this field and I am looking for full time opportunities to apply the skills that I learned both independently and through post secondary.
