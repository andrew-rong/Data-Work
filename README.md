Hi I'm Andrew Rong

I'm interested in a variety of things such as Data Analytics, Financial Mathematics and Machine Learning.

You'll find in here some projects that I have done, ranging from learning how to use APIs, to full blown analysis on datasets.

This is something that I started to do out of enjoyment, but I am looking for full time opportunities to apply the skills that I learned both independently and through post secondary.
